### References & Resources
We ethically pull from a variety of existing therapy websites and clinical instutitions in order to act as a hub to bridge the gap between you and the help you deserve. This way, it is easier for people who are curious and who might potentially lack the support they need in order to get assurance, assistance and the support they need.
In order to search for symptoms of mental conditions, go look at the [Conditions](/conditions) directory. If you need to look for a therapist or other medical assistance near you, take a look at our [Find](/find) feature.
