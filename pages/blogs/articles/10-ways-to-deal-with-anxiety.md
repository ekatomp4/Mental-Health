### Intro
Anxiety is not a personal flaw—it’s a signal. It’s your mind trying (sometimes too hard) to protect you, anticipate danger, and maintain control. The problem isn’t that anxiety exists; it’s that it often grows louder when we fight it instead of understanding it.

Here are **10 grounded, compassionate, and practical ways** to work with your anxiety—the *Bean Way* 🐼.

---

### 1. Name It Without Judging It

Instead of saying *“Something is wrong with me,”* try:
> “I’m feeling anxious right now.”

Labeling anxiety neutrally creates distance. You are **experiencing** anxiety—you are not anxiety.

---

### 2. Stop Trying to Eliminate It

Paradoxically, anxiety grows when we demand it disappear. Let it be present without rushing to fix it.

Think of anxiety like a nervous passenger in your car:
- You don’t kick them out mid-drive  
- You just don’t let them grab the wheel

---

### 3. Ground Yourself in the Body

Anxiety lives in the future. Your body lives in the present.

Try one:
- Press your feet into the floor
- Name 5 things you can see
- Hold something cold or textured
- Take a slow breath and extend the exhale

You’re telling your nervous system: *“We’re safe right now.”*

---

### 4. Question the Catastrophe

Ask gently:
- What am I afraid will happen?
- How likely is that—really?
- If it did happen, could I cope?

Anxiety often mistakes *possibility* for *certainty*.

---

### 5. Create Tiny Predictable Rituals

An anxious mind craves certainty. Give it small anchors:
- Morning tea
- A nightly wind-down song
- A consistent walk route
- Writing one sentence a day

Stability doesn’t need to be dramatic—it just needs to be reliable.

---

### 6. Reduce Information Overload

Too much news, scrolling, comparison, and noise keeps your brain in alert mode.

Try:
- One intentional check-in instead of constant updates
- Curating your feeds
- Taking breaks without guilt

Peace often enters through subtraction.

---

### 7. Move—Gently and Often

Movement releases stored stress chemicals. It doesn’t have to be intense:
- Walking
- Stretching
- Dancing badly
- Rocking
- Cleaning with music

Motion reminds your body it can *flow*, not just brace.

---

### 8. Speak to Yourself Like Someone You Love

Would you tell a friend:
> “You’re weak for feeling this way”?

Practice replacing harsh inner dialogue with:
- “This is hard, and I’m doing my best.”
- “It makes sense that I feel this way.”

Compassion calms faster than criticism.

---

### 9. Allow Some Disharmony

Anxiety often comes from chasing perfect balance, approval, or control.

You are allowed to:
- Disappoint someone
- Be misunderstood
- Be imperfect
- Let things be messy

Peace doesn’t come from harmony—it comes from **flexibility**.

---

### 10. Ask for Help Without Shame

Anxiety thrives in isolation. Whether it’s:
- A trusted friend
- A therapist
- A support group
- A moment of honesty

Reaching out is not weakness—it’s regulation.

---

## Final Thoughts

You don’t need to *conquer* your anxiety to live well. You need to **understand it, listen to it, and move with it**. Think of yourself like King Julian.

You are not broken.  
You are human.  
And you’re allowed to take this one breath at a time.
And then you can move on.
