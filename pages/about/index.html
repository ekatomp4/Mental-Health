      This campaign is dedicated to raising awareness about mental health and
      promoting well-being for all individuals. We believe that everyone
      deserves access to resources and support for their mental health journey.
      Our mission is to break the stigma surrounding mental health issues and
      encourage open conversations. We provide educational materials, support
      networks, and advocacy for mental health policies. Together, we can create
      a community where mental health is prioritized and everyone feels
      empowered to seek help when needed.

          <h2>What is Mental Health?</h2>
          <p class="m-3">
            Mental health is a critical component of overall health and
            well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and behave in our daily
            lives. Unfortunately, many people still face barriers when it comes to
            accessing mental health care and support. By supporting this campaign,
            you are helping to raise awareness about the importance of mental
            health and the need for accessible resources. Your involvement can
            help create a more inclusive and supportive environment for those
            affected by mental health challenges.
